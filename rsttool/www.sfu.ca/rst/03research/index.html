      </span>
      <p class="text">By Bill Mann, March 2000<br>
        <br>
        This page is slightly out of date, mostly because some of these topics
      have been taken up, and other applications exist. </p>
      <p class="text">There are numerous
              open questions involving RST. This page is designed to give you a
              feel for this diversity of issues, and in particular to help students
              who are in the process of selecting thesis or dissertation topics,
              and researchers who want to study in the neighborhood of RST. For
        each one: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">1. I do
              not know of any full scale exploration of the subject in the literature,
              and <br>
          2. I believe that
              it could be a genuine contribution to the art to do such an exploration,
            and <br>
          3. I do not know of
            any substantial sized effort that is ongoing and partly completed on
            the topic (but there could be some.) In a few cases, there has been
            work that needs to be repeated, validated and perhaps extended.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text"> <br>
        I am not trying to identify thesis/dissertation-sized issues; that
          is a matter for the teaching department. In some cases, one question
          would take several theses to explore well. In other cases, several
          related questions might be gathered to help define one thesis topic.<br> 
        <br>
        Also, I am not attempting to accommodate ancient academic boundaries.
          We should feel free to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines.
          Certainly psychology, philosophy, linguistics, sociology, computer
          science and some other disciplines all bear on the issues below.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="titles"><strong>Groups of open issues:</strong></span><br>
        <br>
        <strong>What actually happens in texts?</strong><br>
        It is easy,
          and also risky, to presume about what surely happens in text. Many
          of the facts about the text that exhibits particular RST structure
          are unknown or nearly so. Some of our &quot;general&quot; knowledge
          has been derived only from texts in a single language, only from a
          small sample of texts, and only from unsystematic sampling. For many
          of these topics it is not necessary to do a large sample study in order
          to make progress; suggestive empirical results are easy to create,
          and are worthwhile for guiding studies of the very few things that
          need large-sample studies.<br> 
        <br>
        This sort of investigation is appropriate in this topic area because
          the basic phenomena are only partly identified. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; What are the different
              patterns actually found in how relations are realized in text?
          What are their frequencies? <br>

              or not? <br>
          &#8226; Under what conditions are Relational Propositions (RPs) defeasible
              or not? [Relational Propositions are implicitly communicated by discourse

              Propositions, see an archived message by Bill Mann to the RSTlist

      </blockquote>
      <p class="text">There are issues of what sorts of differences between languages,
              writing
              traditions, social classes, educational backgrounds and expressive
              training would require adjustments in the RST required to analyze
              the text that various people produce. The notion of coherence seems
              quite
              widely shared, but how do the details differ across society, or
        among the people who act as RST observers? For the latter: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; How consistent
                are individual observers doing RST analysis? To what degree do

                training or experience? <br>
          &#8226; Does RST work on texts that are focused on reasoning or argumentation,
                e.g. from mathematics, astronomy or law? <br>
          &#8226; Comparing oral and written monologues, do the RST patterns or
                signaling patterns differ? <br>
          &#8226;	What patterns are there in the ordering of spans in RST analyses? <br>
          &#8226; How have the set of RST relations and their realization patterns
            varied along with centuries of language change?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text"><strong>Understanding RST
        analysis </strong><br>
        There are only a few studies of how observers function when
        they analyze text. How does subjectivity appear in the
          resulting analyses?<br>
          <br>
        Prevailing opinion, especially following studies by Marcu, suggests
          that rigid left-to-right analysis methods fail. The same is said of
          top down, right to left and bottom up analysis methods. Effective analysis
          seems to be best when it is opportunistic, not algorithmically guided.
          Yet we presume that reading proceeds left to right in some sense, and
          that the observer's access to text is very much like the reader's.
          This paradox could be resolved if it were demonstrated that readers
          move around in texts in a way that resembles good opportunistic analysis.
          It is a speculation, perhaps easily dismissed using the technical literature
          on reading. <br>
          <strong><br>
        RST and Other Linguistic Domains</strong><br>
        The dominant viewpoint
          in the definitions of RST is that it is a way to gather detailed information
          about text in a systematic way. This contrasts, for example with RST
          being an abstract model of some part of the text understanding process. <br>
          <br>
          As an orientation and preparation for building theories or models,
          RST can contribute in interesting ways but it cannot be validated except
          as a small fragment of a larger whole. It requires compatible &quot;modules&quot; or
          subtheories or submodels to interact with. Issues arise about how RST
          and others interact. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; What on the others does RST create, and what
            constraints or demands does it place on the interacting models? (For
            example, several RST relations including Evidence are formulated in
            terms of degrees of belief. This may create a requirement that a semantic
            model be able to somehow represent degrees of belief.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text">Asking about
          these others, as a research planning exercise, involves identifying
          other parts of linguistics that one is willing to (temporarily) take
          for granted as being &quot;good enough for our current purposes.&quot; Each
          such step is therefore controversial, because even the most widely
          acknowledged stable points in linguistics are being questioned. <br>
        Here we can call the Neighboring Linguistic Model NLM, and we can ask
          some underspecified questions: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; What information does RST require
              for which NLM is the obvious source? <br>
          &#8226;	What can RST supply to NLM that will help NLM function effectively? <br>
          &#8226;	Are the frameworks of assumptions of RST and NLM entirely compatible?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text">Among
          the wide range of possible NLMs, these generic areas (as examples of
          distinct NLMs) seem to be particularly open to fruitful interaction:              </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226;	Semantics. <br>
          &#8226;	Speech act theories. <br>
          &#8226; RST and relational propositions in interaction with proposition-like
                  entities of syntax: dependent clauses, adjective modifiers, etc. <br>
          &#8226; The reader's knowledge of the writer, based on the text, its
                  context of appearance and shared cultural expectations about
                  the writer. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text">So,
                    taking semantics as an exemplar, we can ask: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; Can methods
              that explain the recognition of unsignalled relations be reconciled
                        with traditional
                        semantic methods? <br>
          &#8226; Can methods that explain the finding of Relational Propositions
                        be reconciled with traditional semantic methods. </p>

      <p class="text"><strong>How RST Discourse Structure Arises and How it is Recognized
          </strong><br>
        We take RST as it is presently defined to be a method for structured
          description
              rather than a model of how language is used. RST allows us to observe
              with greater precision and certainty than we get from simply reading
            text. Then two very large questions arise:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text">&#8226; How do these regularities
                  that we see using RST reflect how text is <span class="emphasis">read</span> (or how language
            is understood)? <br>
          &#8226; How do these regularities that we see using RST reflect how text
                is <span class="emphasis">created</span> (or how language is produced)?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="text"> Answers to these questions
              would be models of language use, including both information structures
              (or memories) and processes, embedded in some broader view of the
                language user. <br>
        Progress in this area will be incremental and fragmentary for
                the foreseeable future. It is certainly open for indefinitely
      many theses.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Revising RST Analysis: Scope</strong> <br>
        There are numerous ideas about what RST
          -- for no obvious reason -- fails to represent. There is a possibility
          that by increasing the conceptual scope of RST, much more informative
        text descriptions could be created by observers.<br> 
      <br>
          First, notice that RST does not contain any unary operators. It is
          dominated at the relational level by binary (two-argument) operations,
          and at the schema level (see M&amp;T 88) by n-ary operations, along
          with restrictions on mixing relations to particular nuclei. One cluster
          of ideas suggests adding unary operators in the analysis result forms.
          These operators could include: quotation, hedging, doubt, focus, indirectness
          of speech acts, distancing of the writer from certain kinds of responsibilities,
          and other possibilities. Unary operators (UOs) could be added as a
          group or one by one. Each would raise the issue of how that UO can
          be defined independent of form, and whether it carries any compatibility
          constraints relative to other structures.<br>
          <br>
        Another cluster of possibilities concerns analysis form. RST analyses,
          like the diagrams in various styles of grammar, tend strongly toward
          single tree structures for texts. Other comparable varieties of analysis,
          such as Systemic Functional Grammar, use multiple coextensive structures,
          each of which covers the entirety. One result is that the individual
          structures can be much simpler, since the problem of coordinating several
          varieties of knowledge has been dismissed. It has been suggested that
          RST be reformulated to show Systemic-like varieties of structure, which
          (done in an orthodox way) might be called Ideational, Interpersonal
          and Textual. Among other things, this might make it possible to find
          a Textual component of structure that would relate directly to ideas
          of presentational style and genre. It is worth much more exploration
          than it has been given. Revising RST Analysis: Process RST takes a
          distinctive approach to subjectivity in analysis, both restricting
          it and making its role explicit. The consequences of doing so have
          never been systematically explored. Also, the possibility of using
          this approach to subjectivity outside of RST has not been carefully
          considered. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Conceptual Foundations</strong><br>
          <strong>Non-Binary Concepts:</strong> RST is formulated
          using various non-binary concepts, notions that can be fulfilled to
          varying
          degrees. These include, in the reader, belief, desire to act, degree
          of difference (e.g. in Contrast), conceptual compatibility (e.g. in
          Concession), social right to express (e.g. in Justify), and adequacy
          of the reader's prior knowledge (e.g. in Background.). They also include
          (in the observer) plausibility (both singular and comparative plausibility.)<br>
          <br>
        These definitional choices give RST broad representational power in
          analysis, but they also severely restrict how RST ideas can be reconciled
          with more traditional binary ideas in closely related disciplines,
          such as semantics based on logic and set theory.<br>
          <br>
          These choices should be reexamined carefully. It would also be worthwhile
          to reconsider the whole notion of &quot;Relational Propositions,&quot; for
          which the most available interpretation is binary.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Intention: </strong>RST makes explicit use of the notion of the writer's intention,
          and attributes an intention (the &quot;effect&quot;) to every use of
          every relation. This is broad but very shallow. Preliminary work on
          developing RST used the concept of intention much more extensively.
          Of course, it is extremely controversial in some academic circles to
          do so. (See, for example, <em>Intentions in the Experience of Meaning</em> ,
          Raymond W. Gibbs Jr., Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 3-18.) RST
          places few restrictions on what intentions may arise or combine. (For
          example, one might suspect that the intentions associated with low
          subtrees might be restricted to those that somehow serve the higher
          intentions of the text. But there are notational and formulation issues,
          and beyond those it is an unstudied empirical issue whether texts are
          in fact consistent in that way.) Issues of how RST can be elaborated,
          and also made more definite and informative in analysis of writer's
          intention, need to be studied at length. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Scientific Status:</strong> Very little work has been done on the scientific
          status of RST, and of that work almost nothing appears in the literature.
          Especially because of the distinctive treatment of subjectivity and
          the issues of the contrast of descriptions of phenomena with explanations
          of those phenomena, more work would be worthwhile. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Communication:</strong> In 20th century physics, there emerged a &quot;standard
          model&quot; of physical interactions, a consensus against which new
          ideas were measured. Linguistics has no consensus and no &quot;standard
          model of symbolic communication&quot; against which ideas about communication
          might be measured. The convenient and most widely used model, the so
          called &quot;code model,&quot; is also widely rejected. RST also says
          very little about communication, partly for lack of an accepted alternative
          to the code model. Ideas and empirical studies that would relate RST
          to definite notions of communication could become very valuable. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Applications of RST <br>
        </strong>A small number of people have used RST as a writing guide . All such
          use has been entirely informal, but there is the possibility of developing
          a practical aid to writing based on RST. Closely related, we could
          think of RST as a potential basis for conceptual training of students
          or teachers of writing. <br>
        There are a number of computational systems that apply or are inspired
        by RST. The applications include:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text"> &#8226;	text generation, <br>
            &#8226;	automatic summarization, <br>
            &#8226;	text indexing, <br>
            &#8226;	evaluation of students' compositions <br>
            &#8226;	(there are more.)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text">Many of these show promise, but some are not ready
            for general use. Extension or reformulation of existing approaches
            appears worthwhile.<br>
            <br>
          Beyond these, there are ideas that seem approachable but which have
              no literature. Here are examples:</p>
        <p class="text">&#8226; <strong>Discourse-aware Controlled
              languages for translation:</strong> There is presently a collection of proprietary
              and
                public technologies for automatic translation of documents into
              multiple languages, with the difficulties of translation strongly
              limited
                by controlled vocabularies and imposing strong limitations on
          how words
                and syntax are used. To my knowledge, the restrictions in these
              methods are confined to the sentence level. Based on RST, the methods
              could
                be extended to whole texts, to unambiguous meaning and scope
<br>
          &#8226; <strong>Preanalyzed text:</strong> Assume that text,
          written by humans, can be entered into computers attached to underlying
          RST diagrams
                or their
                equivalent,
                representing the writers' low level intentions. Then several
                kinds of support for the writers can be considered:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="text">Regularization
                    of
                    text organization.<br>
            Exhibiting implicit RPs. <br>
            Selective prompting for reader support (background, summaries,
                    restatements, ...).<br>
            Automatic topical outlining. <br>
            Regularization of tense, irrealis and other features across
                    multinuclear sets. <br>
          Assisted reordering.</p>

        <p class="text">As computational research it might be
                    worth trying.</p>
