# RSTTool by Michael O'Donnell, Wagsoft Linguistic Software

The RSTTool is a classic, but dated annotation tool for creating annotations according to Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST).

## TL/DR

As of May 2025, the Linux edition of RSTTool 3.42 is not runnable under Ubuntu 22.04L because its depends on TCL/TK 8.3.

However, the [Windows version 3.45](./www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/RSTTool345Install.exe) can be installed (unzipped) and executed with `wine` (wine-6.0.3, Ubuntu 6.0.3~repack-1).
