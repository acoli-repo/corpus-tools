At the top of the RSTTool Inteface is a menu-bar with three menus:

-   **File**: Offering possibilities for loading, and saving codings or
    text:
    -   *Load RST* : loads in an already-created RST Analysis.
    -   *Save RST* : saves the current RST analysis to a file.
    -   *Save RST* As: saves the current RST analysis to a new location.
    -   *Import Text* : loads in plain text, ready for segmentation and
        analysis.
    -   *Save Text As*: saves the text of the analysis as plain text,
        without segmentation or analysis.
-   **Options**: Allowing you to configure the tool:
    -   *File Save Options* : allows you to nominate whether the
        relation set currently in use is stored in the analyis file, or
        in a separate \"master relation file\".
    -   *Appearance Options*: allows you to change the color scheme used
        in drawing analyses, the default background color of dialogs,
        the font for text, and the width of columns in the diagram.\
        \[NEW\] The changing of fonts is new. If you want to restore the
        font to the standard font which RSTTool starts up in, select the
        top item from the Font list: \"RSTTool default\".
-   **Help**: Access to Information about RSTTool.
    -   *RSTTool Help* : (Win95/98/NT only) brings up the WinHelp file
        for RSTTool (Macintosh and unix/linux users can open the manual
        in Netscape).
    -   *About*: provides details of the current version.
    -   *Release Notes*: shows the Release Notes for the current
        version.
