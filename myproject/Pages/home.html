<li>Run additional checks on your configuration in <a href='index.php?action=admin&act=configcheck'>config check</a>.
<li>Choose which attributes to use on tokens in your <a href='index.php?action=adminedit&id=settings.xml'>settings.xml</a>.
<li>Replace the password of the admin user in <a href='index.php?action=useredit'>user edit</a>, or remove it altogether after adding yourself as admin.
<li>Replace this page in <a href='index.php?action=pageedit&id=home'>page edit</a> by a page explaining your project.
</ul>
