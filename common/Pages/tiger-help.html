<h2>Tiger/CQL Search Language</h2>

<p>TEITOK provides the option to search a CWB corpus with dependency relations using
a cross between the CWB query language and Tiger Search. In this search, tokens can be
identified like in CQP using the notion <b>a:[]</b>, but other than in CWB itself, 
those variables do become part of the output. Furthermore, queries are always related
to the sentence(s) that match them, and subsequent queries are interpreted as providing
additional restrictions on those sentences. Also, it is possible to define relations 
between tokens by using the variable, using <b>&gt;</b> for dominance, <b>$</b> 
for siblings, and <b>.</b> for direct precedence, and <b>.*</b> for precedence.

<h3>Example Queries</h3>

<table style='width: 100%'>
<tr><td>
<pre onclick="runtiger(this);">a:[word="aq.*"]; b:[pos="v"]; b &gt; a;</pre>
<td>Sentences with a verb directly dominating a word starting with "aq"
<tr><td>
<pre onclick="runtiger(this);">a:[lemma="considerar"]; b:[]; a &gt;suj b;</pre>
<td>Variable b will point to all the subjects of the verb <i>aprender</i>
