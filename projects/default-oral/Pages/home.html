<h1>Skeleton Oral Corpus</h1>

<p>This is an empty site to help set-up a new TEITOK corpus meant for oral data. This oral corpus provides a number of 
orally-oriented settings, that can be modified if necessary:<p>

<ul>
<li> The CSS style provides a speaker-turn oriented view, with the @who of each utterance in front of each transcribed utterance
<li> The CQP corpus exports start and end times on utterances, and displays the utterance context by default - this allow the sound of
		each utterance to be played directly from the search result list.
<li> The teiHeader edit is set up for a URL to the audio file, as well as speaker-oriented data
<li> File upload explicitly allows for uploading WAV files
</ul>

<p>The typical XML elements for a TEITOK oral corpus, with their default visulazations, are:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>XML</th><th>Visualization</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;pause/&gt;</th><td><pause type="short"/> - <pause type="long"/></td><td>A pause - to differentiate between short and long pauses you can use type="long" and type="short"</td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;gap/&gt;</th><td>[...]</td><td>A gap in the transcription - you can put the motivation behind the gap in the reason, for instance reason="unintelligible"</td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;unclear&gt;</th><td><unclear>unclear</unclear></td><td>A segment that has been transcribed, but for which the transcription is uncertain </td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;del&gt;</th><td>
    	<br><del type="truncated">befo</del>
    	<br><del type="repetition">the</del> the
    	<br><del type="reformulation">the</del> a
    	</td><td>A segment that has been "deleted", which is, corrected by the speaker. There are three typical types:
        <br/>&lt;del type="truncated"&gt; - a truncated word / false start
        <br/>&lt;del type="repetition"&gt; - a repeated segment where the speaker "stutters"
        <br/>&lt;del type="reformulation"&gt; - where the speaker reformulates what he started</td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;vocal&gt;</th><td><vocal><desc>Uhm</desc></vocal></td><td>An extralinguistic element - the description goes inside: &lt;vocal&gt;&lt;desc&gt;Uhm&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;/vocal&gt; 
        stands for an "uhm" sound.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;kinesic&gt;</th><td><kinesic><desc>Clap</desc></kinesic></td><td>A kinesic element - the description goes inside: &lt;kinesic&gt;&lt;desc&gt;Clap&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;/kinesic&gt; 
        stands for a clapping sound.</td></tr>
    <tr><th>&lt;anon&gt;</th><td><anon>John</anon></td><td>An anonymized segment - with an option type, say type="person". Can be used later to
        blank out the corresponding segments in the audio file semi-automatically</td></tr>

<ul>
<li><a href='index.php?action=login'>Login</a> as nobody@nowhere.com / defaultpassword
<li>Add yourself as an admin user in <a href='index.php?action=useredit'>user edit</a>, and remove the dummy admin user.
<li>Run additional checks on your configuration in <a href='index.php?action=admin&act=configcheck'>config check</a>.
<li>Replace the main.tpl template to reflect your name, and ideally even giving it your own look-and-feel (colours, logos, etc.).
<li>Choose which attributes to use on tokens in your <a href='index.php?action=adminedit&id=settings.xml'>settings.xml</a>.
<li>Replace this page in <a href='index.php?action=pageedit&id=home'>page edit</a> by a page explaining your project.
</ul>
