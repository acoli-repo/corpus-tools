<h1>Skeleton Learner Corpus</h1>

<p>This is an empty site to help set-up a new TEITOK corpus meant for learner corpora. This learner corpus provides a number of 
learner-oriented settings, that can be modified if necessary:<p>

<ul>
<li> The CSS style provides a manuscript oriented view
<li> The CSS style also provides a speaker-turn oriented view, with the @who of each utterance in front of each transcribed utterance
<li> Each token is provided with multiple levels of target hypotheses with their annotations
<li> The teiHeader edit is set up for a learner data and task data
</ul>

<p>As the owner of this project you may wish to at least do the following things, and do the first two as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li><a href='index.php?action=login'>Login</a> as nobody@nowhere.com / defaultpassword
<li>Add yourself as an admin user in <a href='index.php?action=useredit'>user edit</a>, and remove the dummy admin user.
<li>Run additional checks on your configuration in <a href='index.php?action=admin&act=configcheck'>config check</a>.
<li>Replace the main.tpl template to reflect your name, and ideally even giving it your own look-and-feel (colours, logos, etc.).
<li>Refined your <a href='index.php?action=adminsettings'>settings</a>.
<li>Replace <a href='index.php?action=pageedit&id=home'>this page</a> by a page explaining your project.
</ul>
