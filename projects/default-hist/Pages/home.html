<h1>Skeleton Historic Corpus</h1>

<p>This is an empty site to help set-up a new TEITOK corpus meant for historic corpora. This historic corpus provides a number of 
manuscript-oriented settings, that can be modified if necessary:<p>

<ul>
<li> Each word is provided with a normalised form (modernised, regularised), a diplomatic form, and an expanded form
<li> The metadata are set up for a description of the manuscript, as well as author-oriented data
<li> File upload explicitly allows for uploading Facsimile images
</ul>

<p>As the owner of this project you may wish to at least do the following things, and do the first two as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li><a href='index.php?action=login'>Login</a> as nobody@nowhere.com / defaultpassword - which you will be asked to change
<li>Run additional checks on your configuration in <a href='index.php?action=admin&act=configcheck'>config check</a>.
<li>Replace the Smarty template and CSS style files to reflect your own look-and-feel (colours, logos, etc.).
<li>Refined your <a href='index.php?action=adminsettings'>settings</a>.
<li>Replace <a href='index.php?action=pageedit&id=home'>this page</a> by a page explaining your project.
</ul>
