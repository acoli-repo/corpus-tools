# ACoLi corpus tools

Selected third-party corpus tools archived or adapted by the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) lab at University of Augsburg, Germany, primarily for classroom use. This is specifically for software for which we provide customizations or special instructions. We neither include our own software (which reside in separate repositories) nor existing off-the-shelf solutions.

- [`teitok-docker/`](teitok-docker) development files for our customized [TEITOK Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chiarcos/teitok-docker)
- [`rsttool/`](rsttool) archive and running instructions for [Mick O'Donnel's legacy RSTTool](http://www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/). This is an ancient piece of software, and requires some workarounds for running -- but it still is the only Desktop tool for annotating discourse structure according to Rhetorical Structure Theory. For a more advanced, but server-based solution, see [rstWeb](https://gucorpling.org/rstweb/info/).
